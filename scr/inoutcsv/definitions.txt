Every character except the blank or space are counted. Please note,
that not only letters are counted, but exclamation marks or points as well.

Please regard the first definition of a word. In this statistic,
it doens't matter if a word starts with an lower or upper case letter different,
f.e. at the beginning of a sentence. As long as the words themselves are identical, there are no different frequency distributions.
